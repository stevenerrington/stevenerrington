### Hi there 👋

🎓 I'm a PhD Candidate in the Dept of Psychology at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/psychological_sciences/bio/steven-errington), where I am in my _final_-year.

## My research

✅ Cognitive control allows us to flexibly allocate our cognitive resources (such as attentional, perception, and motor systems) to achieve our goals. 
🛑 This ability is important when we need to stop ourselves from doing something that is automatic, but wrong - this is known as response inhibition.
🧠 Although response inhibition has been well studied in both humans and monkeys (which share a LOT of the same behaviours/anatomy/etc...), the parts of the brain that do this are debated. 
🐒 In particular, activity in an area known as medial frontal cortex is thought to occur early enough to actively stop actions in humans, but occurs too late in monkeys.
⚡ In my PhD, I looked at the association between medial frontal cortex function and cognitive control across multiple scales: from behaviour, to EEG on top of the head, to local field potentials within the brain, to activity at the single-neuron level.
